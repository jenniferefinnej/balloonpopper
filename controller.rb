#first contruct a player and them going against the computer
#so initialize so that the player and computer are recognized in the code
#maybe then make a method so that you structure what the computer can do so like a "results" and see what the comp. can do
#then go on to making a class for the player to access to the game and allow it to do stuff like the comp.
#index initialize the game so that the game is allowed to run throughout the index
#need a time frame - under a minute
#display a grid of balloons
#nested data structure
#the players need to pop the balloons --> they have two states blown up state and pop state
